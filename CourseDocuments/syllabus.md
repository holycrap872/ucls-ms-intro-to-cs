# Middle School Computer Science

This course provides students an introductory look into the world of computers
and exposes them to big ideas in Computer Science. It is intended to demystify
the computer and give students the confidence to look "inside" the various
abstractions that give computers their power.

In the first part of the course, students will be exposed to the basics of
programming. The goal will be to understand the fundamentals of computational
thinking and to identify opportunities to utilize automation. In the second
part, they will utilize this knowledge to understand different "levels" of
abstraction within the computer. This will include seeing how 1's and 0's can be
used to represent all manners of data including pictures and text. It will also
include understanding how the parts of computers work together to provide a
single, unified experience.

The theme of the course will be "it's not magic." Students will learn to assess
the power that abstraction provides to its users. They will also learn how
abstraction can be used to take power away from users. The aim will be to
instill confidence when approaching new technologies and to understand the
tradeoffs inherent in the decision to utilize automation.

## Essential Questions

- How can we utilize common programming paradigms to automate boring or
  repetitive work?
- What are strategies that we can use to decompose a problem in order to make it
  simpler to understand?
- What is abstraction and how does it relate to our ability to reason
  effectively?
- What tradeoffs are there when it comes to moving between levels of abstraction?

## Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate confidence as problem solvers and computational thinkers.
- Learn independence and self-sufficiency when using technology.
- Use prior knowledge to logically approach unfamiliar problems.
- Work individually beyond situations presented in class.
- Collaborate effectively with peers.
- Understand the theory behind devices used in everyday life.
- Apply programming and engineering concepts to real world problems.
- Have the ability to translate ideas to a computer.
- Represent and interpret data in a meaningful way.

## Required Tests and Materials

No texts are required. All instructional materials will be posted on Schoology.

No specific computing resources are required. Students will be given access to
the necessary tools/materials within the classroom.

## Coursework

Assignments for this course can be broken up into different types which will
typically involve:

- Classwork (during class): This will involve programming challenges and other
  types of projects that you will complete individually or with partners to
  practice the concepts that are presented. Usually, you will be able to finish
  these assignments during class. Regular parts that aren't completed during
  class time will usually need to be finished outside of class time before the
  next class period. **Late classwork will receive a letter grade deduction.**
- Homework (after class): Short assignments (done individually) to practice
  and develop mastery of the material covered in class. **Late homework will
  receive a letter grade deduction.**

Late or revised classwork, projects, or homework will be accepted with a
letter-grade penalty up until the end of a unit. Once we move on to the next
unit, no late or revised work from the prior units will be accepted.

## Grading and Assessment

Units will be weighted according to the amount of time that we spend on them,
and unit grades will be broken down into the following categories:

- Classwork: 80%
- Homework: 20%

Grades for assignments will be posted on Schoology.

## Time Expectations

If you are diligent during the time provided in class, you will only have
homework about half the time. When there is homework, you should not expect
anything more than 10-15 minutes of homework per class period. All homework
assignments will be posted on Schoology.

## Academic Integrity Policy

You are encouraged to work together with your fellow classmates during class
time on activities, but homework assignments (unless otherwise noted) are meant
to be done individually. This is because these assignments are meant to assess
whether you have grasped the material and can complete the problems without
outside help.

You are required to turn in your own work. Copying/pasting from **any** source
without citation is not acceptable. Looking at someone else's work and
reproducing it is not acceptable. Discussing an assignment with other students
and helping other students troubleshoot broken code is acceptable, but you
should never dictate your code to another student but should, rather, guide them
along a path of inquiry.

The spirit of this policy is to make sure that you are the owner of the work
you are producing. If you are unable to explain a solution you produce, you
will receive a zero for the assignment and the Dean of Students will be
notified.

## Accommodations Statement

All of us learn in different ways and the organization of any course may need
to accommodate each student differently. For example, you may prefer to process
information by speaking and listening, so that some of the written material for
this course may be difficult to absorb. Please talk to me as soon as you can
about your individual learning needs and how this course can best accommodate
them. If you require accommodations to participate fully in this course, please
let me know as soon as possible.

## Email Policy

Generally, I do not check email between 7pm and 7am (the next school day).
Students who email me during these hours should not expect a response until
after 7am.

## Absence Policy

If you miss a class, you should review the materials on Schoology and follow up
with me if there’s anything there that you don’t understand.

## Expectations

Generally, I expect you to be invested in the class and to be an active and
positive member of our classroom community. In addition, I expect you to take
your development seriously as a reader, writer, and programmer. The following
are some specific guidelines that will help you to meet these expectations:

- Come to class prepared. This means you should have completed all of the
  assignments due for that day’s class.
- Remain open-minded and sensitive during class discussions.
- Remain focused on the topic being covered for the day. This means **not
  switching to some other homework or game** unless explicitly given permission.
- Treat the equipment that you use during class with respect. Clean up after
  yourself and leave the room in a better state than you found it.
- Laptops, Cell Phones, Ipads, and other electronic devices are useful tools but
  also wonderful distractions. Your laptop should be charged for class, but
  it should only be open when instructed. **Place your cell phones in your
  backpack. If you need to use it during class, quietly raise your hand and
  explain the situation when I come over to talk to you.**
- I expect each of you to make a solid, good-faith effort to do your best in
  this class (and I expect the same from myself). I know, however, that this
  class is just one of many aspects of your life, so please talk to me if you
  need help doing your best work.
- If you have questions or concerns, please ask me anytime. Also, please ask
  if you don’t know why we’re doing something or if you have a better idea.

In addition to the above expectations, you should complete all assignments and
readings to the best of your abilities, setting and achieving high standards for
your work. This desired work ethic includes demonstrating a willingness to seek
guidance, to take suggestions with open-mindedness, and to act on the feedback
received in revising assignments and preparing future work.
