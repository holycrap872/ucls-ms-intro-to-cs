## Essential Questions

- When is it the right time to use a loop?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Have one student's maze from a previous example selected as an example.
- Have PRIMM square example up and ready to run in Scratch
- `01_01_scratch_loops_worksheet` loaded into Schoology and ready to go
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P3fhpg8kDkK9lqLpMQLzlOoGNlZLvoBuSb-CLwL3xBc/edit

### Actual Lesson

    - How to login/log out
    - Show a a maze from previous class
    - How did we get the sprite to move more slowly?
        - Show them
        - Called frame rate... will be useful when we start to do video games
- Today we're going to talk about loops
    - Why would you use a loop?
        - Have them come up with a few real-life examples

    - Have self-assess

### Homework

- None if work hard during the class


### Actual Lesson Day 2

- Review
    - Loops
    - Initialization
    - Pair programming
- PRIMM
    - Show code that makes a square and have them guess what it does
    - Show code that makes a square at the edge of every triangle and have them guess what it does
    - Run triangle -> square program in Scratch
- Continue with Shapes
