## Essential Questions

- When is it the right time to use a loop?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Have one student's maze from a previous example selected as an example.
- Have PRIMM square example up and ready to run in Scratch
- `00_scratch_loops_worksheet` loaded into Schoology and ready to go
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QJ3Ye5Kob1owHJ9wxTG5fqtDNp6qh0nCd-ofXPj5gpg

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - How to login/log out
    - Show a a maze from previous class
        - Ask for volunteer
    - How did we get the sprite to move more slowly?
        - Show them
        - Called frame rate... will be useful when we start to do video games
- Today we're going to talk about loops
    - Why would you use a loop?
        - Have them come up with a few real-life examples
            - Breathing
            - Going to school
    - PRIMM of square code
    - Do some examples together
        - Stress initialization
        - Triangle
            - Internal vs. external angle
        - Circle
- Going to work in pairs
    - Explain expectations of navigator and driver
    - Pair programming theater
        - Act out a bad pair programming team
        - Act out a good pair programming team
    - Every time finish problem, switch
- Worksheet on Schoology
    - Talk through worksheet
    - Go!

### Homework

- None if work hard during the class

### Actual Lesson Day 2

- Review
    - Loops
    - Initialization
    - Pair programming
- PRIMM
    - Show code that makes a square and have them guess what it does
    - Show code that makes a square at the edge of every triangle and have them guess what it does
    - Run triangle -> square program in Scratch
    - Add code to then have a third loop
        - Guess what it does?
    - Fiddle with it to make it cool
        - Add `change color by`
        - Add whole things inside a loop that does the original shape and rotates slightly
- Continue with Shapes
- End with reflection
    - Why loops?
    - How to deconstruct patterns
