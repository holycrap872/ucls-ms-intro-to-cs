## Essential Questions

- How does programming a computer compare to programming a human?

## Lesson Plan

In this lesson, students review what it means to be a computer. Then, if it's
a long block, they do a card-sorting energizer which leads to talks about
algorithms. Finally, as a class we review Scratch and make a deterministic maze.

> Note: This lesson varies a bit depending on whether it's a long block
  (typical), or whether it's a short block (only for Q1).
    - If it's a long block, students should both do the card_sorting energizer
      _and_ finish the maze.
    - Otherwise, students should **not** do the energizer and not finish the
      maze. Both will be done in the following class.

### Setup

- All students set up on a Scratch account
- Proper Scratch login info (YYYY-MM-DD-secX-XX) inserted into Slideshow
- 6 decks of cards
- YouTube videos loaded up and ready to go

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - What's a computer?
    - What's a programming language?
    - What did we do last time?
    - Can use algorithms to create a maze

- IF LONG BLOCK
    - see `../course_energizers/00_card_sorting` for lesson
- Today going to start to use Scratch
    - Walk through logging in/logging out of Scratch
        - Things to hit:
            - Logging in, naming project, saving, sharing
        - Watch me:
            - What do you notice?
    - Have everyone Log in
        - Login format: `2024-04-09-sec5-ab`
        - Laptops closed once successfully logged in
    - Program a maze together
        - Create a simple maze in background
            - Green for start
            - Red for end
        - Show where to program sprite and background
        - Show pen
        - Stress initialization
            - When green flag clicked
            - Always start in same position/rotation
    - Blocks we're not using
        - glide
        - when space clicked
- Have them go and **start** a maze of their own
    - Read through rubric
    - Summarize
    - Make sure to name and share your program
    - Go!
- IF LONG BLOCK
    - 
    - Will have next class to finish
