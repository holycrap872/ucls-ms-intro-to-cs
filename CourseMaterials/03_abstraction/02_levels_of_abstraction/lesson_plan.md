## Essential Questions

- How does abstraction help us as we go about our daily lives?
- What situations are necessary to "break through" abstraction levels?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Schoology Assessment `Levels of Abstraction` posted for Homework
- Supplies for activity
    - 20-30 sheets of legal paper
    - Pencils/markers
    - Rulers
- Youtube videos ready to go
    - Siphon effect: https://youtube.com/shorts/V510005jDug?si=j-XjEA3gdYGTvD5p
    - How a toilet works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqcYXeJ02U8

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection:
    - What is abstraction?
        - Hiding unnecessary details
    - What does abstraction look like in art?
    - What does abstraction look like in CS?
        - How was the race car game an example of abstraction?
            - Functions
            - I designed the functions - you used them
- Discussion about the similarities between abstraction in art and CS
    - In both, we:
        - Simplify complex ideas or systems
        - Focus on the essential components
        - Hide intricate details
- This type of abstraction is everywhere
    - For example, how would you tell someone how to bake a cake?
        - Ask students
        - Have them create program of 5-6 steps
        - Becoming less abstract is like an annoying sibling going "well how do you do that?"
        - Go out to level 3-4 for something until saying stuff like "lift hand 3 inches"
- Have student describe process to go to bathroom
    - Write each sentence up on board **NOT ON PROJECTION AREA SO DON'T HAVE TO ERASE**
        1. walk to bathroom
        2. go into stall
        3. XXXX
        4. flush
        5. go back to class
    - Break out "walk to bathroom" into sub program
        - Stand up
        - Left foot/right foot
        - ...
    - Who knows how flushing works?
        - Show siphon effect video: https://youtube.com/shorts/V510005jDug?si=j-XjEA3gdYGTvD5p
        - Show video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqcYXeJ02U8
    - Break out `flush` step into its own 
        - Sideways tree structure
- This way of viewing things can be used everywhere
    - High level detail with more detail waiting underneath when required
    - Demystification if go inside
- Group Activity:
    - In pairs, write a step-by-step program (pseudocode) for accomplishing a task
        - Break out to three levels
    - Have one group work on the board
    - Possible topics:
        - Making a car
        - Kidnapping a monkey from the zoo
    - Emphasize that the crazier the better
    - Possible extension: have groups switch programs every few minutes
        - People fill in the "how to" of other teams "high level functions"
- Go!
- Discussion:
    - Put up two figures, one with a tree like structure and one with just a list of 0-100
        - Which one is more abstract and why?
    - How is this like abstract art?
    - How many levels deep could you go?
    - How is this like scratch?

### Homework

- Schoology Assessment `Levels of Abstraction`

#### Possible extension

- For next class: How is this like being a good leader/project?
    - Leader thinks about high-level tasks. Workers think about how those get accomplished.
    - Call back to sorting game
