- What are functions?
- Why are functions useful?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Ready to play https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/935636797/
- Schoology set up with short or long skeleton
    - long: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/908713802/
    - short: TBD

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - Game loop
    - Sensors
    - Line following algorithm
    - Play someone's Tracking Bot game
- What are functions?
    - Input/Output
        - f(x) example
    - CS's function are very similar in concept to math
- Why functions
    - Don't have to know what's going on inside
    - What are things that don't know how they work but use w/ input and output?
        - Vending machines
            - How many inputs?
                - 3: money, button 1, button 2
            - How many outputs?
                - 1: Crispy bacon
            - Why like a function?
                - Magic on the insides
    - Glide block
        - Why like a function?
        - How many inputs?
        - How many outputs?
- New game
    - Show race car game
- Explain game
    - Complex - requires 10th grade physics
    - Therefore, giving you some blocks
- Show blocks I created
    - How can we use these blocks?
    - Show the blocks themselves
    - Explain going to build game _next to_ existing blocks
        - e.g., Put green flag to the left of the existing stuff
- Go!
- Extensions
    - Second racer
    - Explosions if hits wall
    - Ask at the beginning how big an engine the user wants
    - Switch to "muddy costume" when in green
