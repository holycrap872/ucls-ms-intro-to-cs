## Essential Questions

- Why is abstraction useful for solving problems?
- How do we create useful abstractions?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Robozzle worksheet loaded into schoology and ready to go
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a9sGyakYHO3ej388u7QaSBqTtEpsBJV7Gmp643Z1MAU/edit

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - Define abstraction
    - Where do we see abstraction
        - Art
        - CS
        - Real life
    - How are functions like abstraction?
    l   - Draw the "abstraction tree chart" from the previous lesson
- Today going to play some logic puzzles
    - Show robozzle and explain how the program works
        - **Just like scratch**
            - f1 -> "when green flag clicked"
            - Program runs block 
    - Walk through a two levels
        - http://www.robozzle.com/beta/index.html?puzzle=-1
            - Explain how game works
            - Explain how interface works
            - Make sure to explain have to click through "intro" code
        - http://www.robozzle.com/beta/index.html?puzzle=-2
            - Explain how f1 runs first
            - Can call f2 from f1
            - How is this like functions?
- Explain process
    - Go down sheet puzzle by puzzle
    - Can play in pairs but each person needs to submit GoogleDoc w/ screen shots
- Go!
- Before end of class
    - What are "functions"
    - Why are they useful
        - Save space
        - Repeat patterns
        - Programming is like origami: folding!
    - Explain a level as if it was an "abstraction tree chart"
        - f1 is "high level"
        - f2 is "broken out" lower level details
        - What's a better name for f2?
