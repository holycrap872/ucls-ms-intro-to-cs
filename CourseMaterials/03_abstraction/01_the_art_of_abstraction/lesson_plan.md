## Essential Questions

- Why is abstraction important?
- How do we determine if something is necessary for a particular task?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Bunch of paper cut in half
- Bunch of markers/colored pencils

### Actual Lesson

- Reflect
    - What did we talk about last class?
    - What are functions?
    - What is abstraction?
- Discussion: begin with a brief discussion about art
    - Ask the students if they know what abstract art is
    - Why did art get weird in the late 1800's?
        - Previously about capturing all possible details (as lifelike as possible)
        - Once camera invented, needed to go in a new direction
            - Camera invented in 1839
        - One direction was abstract art
        - Painters tried to capture the essence of an idea
        - Let everything else fall away
- Image Showcase: Show progression of images that go from realistic to very abstract
    - Abstract People
        - Self-Portrait with a Harp by Rose-Adélaïde Ducreux
        - Lydia Leaning on Her Arms by Mary Cassatt
        - Portrait of Dr. Gachet by Vincent Van Gogh
        - Girl with a Mandolin by Pablo Picasso
        - Embrace by Lee Krasner
    - Landscapes
        - Mount Adams, Washington by Albert Bierstadt
        - Haystacks by Claude Monet
        - Mountains at Collioure by Andre Derain
        - Lake George Reflection by Georgia O’Keefe
        - Night Sea by Agnes Martin
    - Discuss what we're seeing at each level
    - How does this relate to abstraction?
- Group Activity:
    - Have students select an object (or idea!!!) and look it up online
    - Each will draw (in semi-secret) the object three times:
        - First, as detailed and realistically as they can.
        - Second, in a simplified form with fewer details.
        - Third, in a very abstract form.
- Once everyone is done, show each progression (from most to least abstract)
    - Have students try and guess what it is
    - If guessed quickly, what could be removed? If couldn't guess, what should be added?
- Discussion:
    - What was easy and what was hard about identifying the images?
    - How did you determine that something was necessary while drawing?
    - What were some cool things we saw?
    - Do you like abstract art?
    - Abstract thinking is part of development. What does this mean?
- Clean up
    - Have students sign their favorite
    - Put away pencils

## Thoughts

- We could make this a pictionary type game where you can do a single line
  or circle at a time. Keep going until someone guesses.
