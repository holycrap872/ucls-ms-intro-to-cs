### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - What did we do last class?
    - What was the purpose?
        - NOT to remember shell commands forever
        - To take something we thought was "evil"/"mysterious" to something we know
        - To prove we can learn something hard
    - What commands do we remember?
    - How do these commands relate to the GUI?
    - `sleep 10 && say "boo"`
- Show my computer via terminal
    - Navigate from home into MS lesson plans
    - Talk about how you can see stuff
        - List of all of the lessons we've done so far
    - Why is my computer ordered this way (folder in folders?)
        - Organization
- History of OS
    - All computers come from "unix"
        - https://youtu.be/tc4ROCJYbm0?si=AJyQkRl749Gh5024&t=720
            - 12:00 - 14:34
            - 26:05 - 26:30 for very weird computer dance
        - What did we see in that movie?
            - Use of `ls`
            - `cd`
            - Folder hierarchy
    - All websites model unix
        - `/` at every page
        - Schoology as an example
- Show picture of Linux folder structure
    - Root at the top
    - Everything nicely organized underneath
    - Point out `/bin` folder
        - Most important folder in the computer (bit of a lie but w/e)
        - All programs that run behind the scenes when you use your computer
    - Show `/bin` on my computer
        - Show contents of `ls`
        - Show contents of `cd`
- Emphasize why is it good to have a tree
    - Show good desktop
    - Show bad desktop
        - Search "messy desktop"
- Next class going to take apart a computer
- Today going to talk about computers and how they work
    - What are some words you know about computers?
- Speeds/Sizes
    - Kilo, Mega, Giga
    - Compare to number of characters in a poem, novel, ...
    - If I have a 4Ghz process, how fast is it?
- Show each computer part
    - Discuss
    - Pass around

#### Homework

- Schoology Assessment
    1. Arrange the following from smallest to to largest.
        - 1 terabyte
        - 1 byte
        - 1 kilobyte
        - 1 megabyte
        - 1 gigabeta
    2. What part of the computer stores the information while it is off?
        - CPU
        - Memory
        - Hard drive
        - Power cable
    3. What part of the computer is in charge of all of the "processing"?
        - CPU
        - Memory
        - Hard drive
        - Power cord
    4. How many times bigger is a megabyte than a kilo byte
        - 10
        - 100
        - 1,000
        - 10,000
    5. Why is a fan necessary in a computer?
        - The hard drive needs to feel very important otherwise it won't keep running.
        - The CPU has so much electricity running through it that it would melt without a fan.
        - Memory needs fresh air to remember stuff properly.
        - The electricity of the 1's and 0's needs to circulate through the computer.
    6. The job of the motherboard in the computer is to:
        - Allow electricity to be stored in the form of 1's and 0's
        - Provide a place just for the CPU
        - Allow all of the other pieces to communicate
        - Arrange the other pieces by height
    7. How many times bigger is 4Ghz than 500Khz
        - 8,000 times
        - 1,000 times
        - 4,000,000 times
        - 18 times
