## Essential Questions

- What is an algorithm?
- How can we use experience to iteratively improve an algorithm?

## Lesson Plan

This introduces to the concept of sorting. It has groups iteratively improve
their algorithm over time.

Length of lesson: 20-30 minutes.

### Setup

- 4-6 decks of cards
- YouTube video loaded up and ready to go
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeoCbJPuvSE

### Actual Lesson

- Provide grounding
    - Sorted data is very important in CS
        - Why is sorted better than not sorted?
            - Phone book
- Explain goals
    - In groups of 3-4 you're going to race to sort a deck of cards
- Stress rules
    - Quiet -> too loud and you're disqualified
    - No bending the cards
- Count off from one to six to divide up into groups
    - Give 3-5 minutes to come up with a strategy
    - Go!
- Brief discussion
    - What was easy?
    - What was hard?
- Redivide into new groups
    - Give 3-5 minutes to come up with a strategy
    - Go!
- Re-divide into new groups
    - If necessary
- Have winning group explain their strategy
- Discussion topics
    - Sorting for census in 1890
    - Parallel algorithms
