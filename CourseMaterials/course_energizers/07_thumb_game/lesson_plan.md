## Essential Questions

- How can we design a system to prevent cheating?

## Lesson Plan

A tournament of finger thumb flipping. Break up into groups of four and have
them flip as quickly as possible. The two winners from the group then advance.

## Setup

None

### Actual Lesson

- Ground
    - It's hard to have thumb up and pointer finger in on one hand with the
      thumb down and pointer finger out on the other hand than switch
    - Demonstrate
    - Practice for a little bit
- Going to have a mini tournament
    - How could we divide this up so that no one cheats?
    - Discuss
        - Possible solution:
            - Break up into groups of 4
            - 2 people will go as quickly as they can with the other two counting
            - Then the counters will go
            - The two with the most flips w/o and error will go to next round
- Go!
- Discussion
    - Did the system work?
    - Did anyone cheat?
