## Essential Questions

- What are lists?
- How can we use functions to ease the complexity of development?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- BitPics saved to desktops of class computers
    - `bitpic_1.txt` (30w x 26h ying-yang)
    - `bitpic_2.txt` (20w x 30h penguin)
    - Allows for quick "importing" into lists

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Binary
    - Morse code
    - BitPics
- Quick lists review
    - How to import data
    - How to read data
    - How to delete data
    - Quick demo that says each item in the list then deletes it
- Today going to build a printer
    - In pairs, go to desktop computer create `print_pixel` function
    - Rotate
    - Use `print_pixel` function to create `print_row` function
        - Hint: picture is 30 pixels wide
    - Rotate
    - Use `print_row` function to create `print_picture` program
        - Hint: picture is 26 pixels wide
- At each stage:
    - Read to catch any bugs in the code they're inheriting
    - Explain how to test
        - Double click
    - Can give little hints to make sure people get it right
        - Have an alternating b/w row that people can test on
        - Have them create their own list to test on
- Do another picture
    - Something cool
- Discuss
