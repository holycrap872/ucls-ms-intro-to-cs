## Essential Questions

- How do computers store information?
- How can computers share information over distance?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Morse Code cheat sheets printed out
- Morse Code worksheets printed out
- The Morse Code "flashers" that are in the CS office
- Youtube videos loaded up:
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJazkW8i--Q

### Lesson Plan

- Reflection
    - Scratch
    - Programming
- Who knows how computers store information?
    - Only thing computers understand: 1's and 0's
    - What types of data do computers represent?
        - Pictures, text, video, audio
        - Today going to talk about text
- Computers don't just store 1's and 0's, we have an internet
    - How could we send 1's and 0's (information) over long distances
        - Set up movie clip by explaining what's going on: sub-sub communication

            - How are the American's sending message?
            - What message are the Russians sending with one bit?
- How could we come up with a system to send words?
    - A's maps to 1 flash, B's maps to 2 flashes ...
    - Note: They all knew morse code already
- What is a 1 in morse code and what is a 0?
- Hand out morse code cheat sheet
- Send various messages
    - Send SOS via lights
    - Have them do example problems in slide show
- Have students encode their own message and send it to a student across the room
    - Use "Morse Code Signal Set" from usgamesinc.com
    - Then switch and send it the other way
    - "I know all the swear words in Morse Code, so don't even try"
- Play a clip where punchline is audio
    - "My friend’s bakery burned down last night. Now his business is" ... TOAST
    - "German sausage jokes are just about the:" ... WURST

- Discussion
    - Why not dits, dahs, dems, and doops?
        - Too difficult to tell apart
    - How did morse code change the world?
    - How is morse code like the internet?
    - How is it different?
- Show picture of "Morse code Tree"
    - Why is this better
    - Do some examples
- Closing worksheet

#### Homework

- Finish worksheet if didn't

### Potential Extension

- As a class, encode in scratch a morse code encoder that uses the tree (nested if/else)
