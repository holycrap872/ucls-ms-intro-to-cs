Programming Introduction

## EQ's

- What is programming?
- Computers are stupid?
- Why are conditionals needed?

## Lesson Plan:

The lesson follows the basic pattern of explanation, activity, debrief. The one
thing to note is that there are two "difficulties": one where students can use
any words they'd like to write the program and one where they're restricted to
a limited vocabulary. This is to drive a discussion about the difficulties of
programming vs. the difficulties of understanding/executing the program.

### Setup

- Lot of pieces of paper
- Ruler
- YouTube videos loaded
    - https://youtu.be/ZMQbHMgK2rw?si=1cjkXvxg_cjumHzg
    - 

### Actual Lesson

- Introduce seating chart
- Reflection
    - Demystification
    - Point of this class
- What is a program?
    - Ask them to come up with examples of a computer
        - They'll say stuff like phone
    - Ask them to come up with their own definition of computer
        - Guide them towards "something that follows instructions"
        - Origin of the word is that it was a human job
            - Just like doctor or lawyer: I'm a computer!
        - Show picture of logarithms tables... this is what computers calculated
    - Ask them to come up with examples of a program
        - Guide them towards recipe
    - Ask them to come up with their definition of a program
        - Series of instructions for a computer to follow
    - Define programming language
        - Scratch
- Introduction:
    - Today we're going to make and solve mazes in a variety of ways
        - Mazes were some of the first demonstrations of the capability of computers

            - 0:00 - 1:40
    - Rules
        - Break up into groups of 2
        - Make a maze (4m)
        - Switch
        - Write a program to solve the maze (3m)
        - Switch
        - One person closes their eyes and sees if they can use the program to get through (2m)
        - Maze Rules
            - Closest of one inch between two lines
    - Example of what going to do on the board
        - I do the example
        - Use ruler to really drive home the point
    - Split in pairs
        - Have one group work on the board
        - Go
- Debrief
    - What was easy and what was hard?
    - Discuss problems with getting units wrong.
        - Mars Rover
    - Discuss why humans with eyes closed is similar to computer (can't react smartly)
        - **Computers are stupid**

#### Homework

- Simple Schoology assessment just to set the expectation of homework
- Questions:
    1. Which of the following would NOT be considered a computer?
        - A laptop
        - A human
        - A recipe
        - A phone
    2. What is the worst that can happen if units of measurement aren't "correct" when a program is executed?
        - Terrible explosions
        - Nothing much
    3. In the example of baking a cake, match up each part of the baking process with its matching Computer Science term.
        - Cook -> Computer
        - Recipe -> Program
        - Ingredients -> Inputs
        - Freshly baked cake -> Output
    4. Which of the following is the best definition of "a program"?
        - A list of instructions that are followed to produce an output.
        - An input driven series of decisions.
        - A series of special words that are associated with actions.
        - A binary language for talking to a digital, electronic computer.
    5. Why, in a modern context, do we prefer electronic computers over human computers? Select the two answers that apply.
        - Electronic computers are more precise
        - Electronic computers are faster
        - Electronic computers are more friendly
        - Electronic computers are more creative
