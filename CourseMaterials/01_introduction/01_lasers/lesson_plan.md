Programming Introduction

## EQ's

- What is programming?
- Computers are stupid?
- Why are conditionals needed?

## Lesson Plan:

The lesson requires a little prep (20m - 30m). It follows the basic pattern of
explanation, activity, debrief. The one thing to note is that there are two
"difficulties": one where students can use any words they'd like to write the
program and one where they're restricted to a limited vocabulary. This is to
drive a discussion about the difficulties of programming vs. the difficulties
of understanding/executing the program.

### Setup

- Get 2 rooms and mark off start and stop
- Hang strings or yarn from walls and ceiling to simulate "lasers"
- Two versions of the worksheet with different "difficulties" printed out

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - Demystification
    - Point of this class
- What is a program?
    - Define program, computer, programming language
- Introduction:
    - Today we're going to write a program to get a blind folded person through
      a laser maze!
        - This is going to be a lot, so need to know you will focus when I ask for attention
    - To get you excited here's Ocean's 12: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUPQfzAyVeI
    - Explanation
        - Rooms downstairs with yarn across ceiling and floor
        - If touch then lose
        - Groups go to different rooms without being able to see
        - Write series of instructions on piece of paper
        - Blind fold someone from the opposing group who didn't see setup and see if they can go through
        - Someone else, with back turned, will read instructions
    - Two types of worksheets: mission hard and mission impossible
- Break up into groups of 3
    - Need volunteer from each group of three
    - Act as team captains but also people going through opposing maze
- Go to rooms and reiterate
    - Let work for 10-15 minutes
- Execute!
    - Person led in with blindfold
    - Person has to read instructions with back to other person
- Come back and discuss
    - Q: What was the hardest part
    - Q: What was unexpectedly easy?
    - Q: How is this similar to programming computers?
    - Q: How is this different from programming computers?
    - Q: Why are we using a restricted set of words?
- Control Flow
    - Q: What would happen if a guard came in?
    - Q: Who remembers words like "if", "else", "repeat" from last year
        - Q: What do they mean?
    - Q: Why didn't we have to use them here?
        - A: Know situation going in -> deterministic
        - A: Conditionals imply sensing
    - Q: What would have required us to use conditionals
        - A: Randomly choose one of the two laser courses
            - If course A: run program 1 ...
    - Q: Identify three instances on a computer that use conditional
        - For example
            - if clicked open this
            - if clicked do this

## Extension (if time needed)

- Maybe `control_statements_worksheet.docx`?

## Homework Assignment

- None
