## Essential Questions

- What are variables?
- How can we use variables to produce more efficient programs?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- `03_01_scratch_variables_music_worksheet` loaded into Schoology
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1osWJ4-gcEh9dyIKa-A2U5FLPZoC5V5XDkvYmPy8KBM8
- Review examples will be making/using in class:
    - https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/945191863/editor/

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Abstraction
        - All the ways we learned about abstraction?
        - Why are functions an example of abstraction?
        - What abstraction is at its core
            - Ways to reason about a complex world
        - Robozzle levels
            - What does f1 mean?
            - What does f2 mean?
- Going to start back up with scratch
    - Scratch review
        - Game loop
        - if, if/else
        - init
- What are variables?
    - Things that can change
    - Lots of math stuff in CS
- Human example
    - Variables can basically do three things
        - set, change, read
    - Demonstrate all of them using people
        - Call up Matt and Nick
        - Matt remember 3, Nick remember 5, Matt + Nick
- Why are variables useful?
    - Allow more general programs
    - Don't have to write program that multiplies every possible number together
    - Instead, just one where plug in variables
- Show variables in Scratch
    - Make own
        - Name them `Nick` and `Matt` or whatever participants names were
        - Replicate actions from in human example
        - See `AddVariables` in https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/945191863/editor/
            - See `variables_1_example.sb3` if link is down
    - Stress that it's important to come up with a good variable name
- Show a tempo increaser that play snare drum faster and faster
    - Ask them what they think will happen
        - See `TempoChange` in https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/945191863/editor/
            - See `variables_1_example.sb3` if link is down
    - Why `set` outside loop?
    - Why `change` inside loop?
    - Make some changes and ask what they think will happen
- Review variables
    - Set
    - Change
    - Store
- Direct to worksheet in Schoology
    - Give 3m to read through it then summarize as class
    - Stress importance of headphones
    - Go!
        - For 40m block, they should get through the first two sections
