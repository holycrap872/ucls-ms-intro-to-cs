## Essential Questions

- How can we use variables to produce more efficient programs?
- How can we use variables to create useful programs for a human user?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Preprogrammed scratch program that plays every instrument
- `03_02_scratch_variables_input_worksheet` loaded into Schoology
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1st5q1I3VydONL_ZTuF5GXMPgSLz9z91EqY23ifBvQiE/edit

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Variables
        - Set, change, store
    - Why are variables useful?
    - Why set outside loop, change inside
- Have program waiting that plays all the instruments (PRIMM)
    - See `Instruments` function in accompanying scratch program
    - Ask them to try and figure out what it does with their elbow partner
    - Review what's going on behind scenes with note change
    - Discuss
        - Could have a 120 line program but that would be annoying
        - Run it and listen to it
        - What's a better name for the `my variable` variable
- Today going to use this ability to make a lot of different types of programs
    - These are classic intro course problems you'll see in 9th grade
- Storing strings
    - Ask for volunteer
    - Create variable named after volunteer (e.g., `eric`)
    - Ask volunteer to think about something
    - Create program `say(join("Eric is thinking about ", eric))` and run it
        - See `ThinkingAbout` function in accompanying scratch program
- Introduce `ask and wait` block
    - Special `ask` variable
    - What user says gets moved into `ask` variable
    - Add onto above program to ask person what they are thinking about
        - See `AskThinkingAbout` function in accompanying scratch program
- Further examples
    - Pounds to kgs
        - Program it together
            - Give them hint that 2.2 lbs per kg
            - See `PoundsToKgs` function in accompanying scratch program
    - Password program (if necessary/have attention)
        - See `Password` function in accompanying scratch program
- Why is `ask and wait` useful?
    - Interaction with user
- Start `variables_2_worksheet.docx`
    - Give 3m to read through it then summarize as class
    - Go!
        - 7th graders get to ~question 6 in a 85m period
        - 9th graders get to ~question 9 in a 85m period
        - Both are starting to lose focus in last 15m (understandably)
