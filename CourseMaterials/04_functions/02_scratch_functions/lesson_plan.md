## Essential Questions

- What are functions?
- Why are functions useful?
- How do we create and use functions in scratch?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- `03_03_scratch_functions_worksheet` loaded into Schoology
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T7y-HDTxLjGatPhP-y9X3WD16TzqQ2hBdV9CXJ8ERBQ
- "Hexagon program" loaded up and ready to go
    - Asks users for number of iterations
    - Draws hexagons with increasing size of sides

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Variables
    - Why useful
    - Review fahrenheit -> celsius program
    - PRIMM on program that draws hexagons of increasing size
- What is a function?
    - Input/output
- Where have we seen functions?
    - Math
    - Robozzle
    - Race car game
- Why functions?
    - Abstraction
    - Easier to reason
    - Decompose a problem into pieces
- Do an example together:
    - Length of time to cook turkey function
        - Input: pounds, stuffed or not
            - 15m per pound stuffed
            - 13m per pound not stuffed
        - Output: say cook time
        - Emphasize that the function needs to be called from the main program
        - Emphasize **what the input variable is**
    - Hexagon together as a class
- Explain/talk through worksheet
    - Work in pairs
- Go!

#### Homework

- None

#### Possible Extensions

- `real_life_functions.docx` printed out for homework
- Slot machine that draws a bunch of different shapes at random
    - "pays out" when shapes match
